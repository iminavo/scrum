## Context

I'm a Scala /strong/ mid, currently in Gdansk, Poland, but my emplyer - YAPS _/jÃ¦ps/_, has offices all over the world for 
about 6000 strong staff. I'm in a team of six, and together with a similar team, we are building a ticketing system, to 
replace a third party. We work remotely - people from different timezones and domains. We need management, and we have it.

Here I will /try to/ keep my notes on processes at my company, in forms of discussions.

## Note semantics

I've noticed, that some of my notes may be too _emotional_, and I'd like to keep personal likings and banter out of these notes.
When I return to them later, I weed out the unimportant bits. It may be so, that after this, the outcome can still be misinterpretted 
/by me/ later. That is why I decided to do the following: when I need to note facts, I'll use quotes. When reading those, do not 
seek my intention in the wording. Even when it can be interpreted as an intention, that is due to my bad writing. I'll do my best to 
avoid such cases. When I need to express my thoughts, I'll use the normal text.

Below is an example:

```
| Narek wasn't able to complete his tasks for the fourth sprint in a row

The issue seems like it could be remedied by a helping hand. Unfortunately, we dont have tools in our processes, 
that express pair programming.
```

The quote does not express my frustration, but states a fact about Nareks' progress. I express my feelings with
the normal text below, where I find a certain fact about our workflow rather daunting.
